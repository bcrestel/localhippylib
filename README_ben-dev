In order to run (most) applications while on the branch ben-dev, you need to
add to your PYTHONPATH the directory for the 'fenicstools' Python library. 
It can be cloned from either the ICES network,
    git clone <username>@moench.ices.utexas.edu:~/repos/fenicstools.git

or from bitbucket,
    git clone https://bcrestel@bitbucket.org/bcrestel/fenicstools.git
