Content:

- FEniCS101.ipynb: A python notebook to introduce the FEniCS. In this tutorial we solve a linear elliptic PDE (diffusion) with a mix of Dirichlet and Newmann boundary conditions

- UnconstrainedMinimization: A python notebook with the minimization of the non-linear energy functional we saw in class

- nb.py: some utilities functions to plot the solution inside a python notebook.

To run the notebook open a FEniCS terminal and type

$ ipython notebooks

A new tab will open in your web-brower showing the two notebooks: FEniCS101 and UnconstrainedMinimization. Click on the notebook you would like to use.

To run all the code in the notebook simply click on Cell --> Run All.

Note: These notebooks have been tested using FEniCS 1.5 on a Mac OS.
These notebooks may not work with previous version of FEniCS.
